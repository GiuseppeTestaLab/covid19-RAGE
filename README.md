**scRNA-seq analysis of PBMC from COVID-19 patients of the Padova cohort**

The code and the data in this repository enables the reproduction of the analyses and plots for 
the single-cell RNA-seq data in the paper "RAGE engagement by SARS-CoV-2 enables monocyte infection and
underlies COVID-19 severity" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.22.492693).
