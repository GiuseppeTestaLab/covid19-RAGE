**scRNA-seq analysis of PBMC from COVID-19 patients of the Padova cohort**

The code and the data in this repository enables the reproduction of the analyses and plots for 
the single-cell RNA-seq data in the paper "RAGE engagement by SARS-CoV-2 enables monocyte infection and
underlies COVID-19 severity" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.22.492693).


An html version of the notebooks is accessible [here](https://GiuseppeTestaLab.github.io/covidiamo-padova/).




## Differential abundance analysis

Links: [html file](https://GiuseppeTestaLab.github.io/covidiamo-padova/02_abundance_analysis_cell_families.html).

This is the RMarkdown code that has been used to compute the differential abundance of the
cell families that have been recognized in the dataset.
