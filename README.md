**scRNA-seq analysis of PBMC from COVID-19 patients of the Padova cohort**

The code and the data in this repository enables the reproduction of the analyses and plots for 
the single-cell RNA-seq data in the paper "RAGE engagement by SARS-CoV-2 enables monocyte infection and
underlies COVID-19 severity" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.22.492693).


An html version of the notebooks is accessible [here](https://GiuseppeTestaLab.github.io/covidiamo-padova/).




## Differential abundance analysis

Links: [html file](https://GiuseppeTestaLab.github.io/covidiamo-padova/02_abundance_analysis_cell_families.html).

This is the RMarkdown code that has been used to compute the differential abundance of the
cell families that have been recognized in the dataset. 




## Test Notebook

Links: [jupyter notebook](prova.ipynb) and [html file](https://matbonfanti.github.io/project-template/prova.html).

This is a **test notebook**. A very basic example of notebook, just to exemplify how the
GitHub Actions defined in this repository work.

If you want to add your own notebooks, just put the ipynb files in the root project folder and then
customize the "pages" section of the [config.yaml](https://github.com/matbonfanti/project-template/blob/main/resources/config.yaml)
file by including the notebooks that need to be indexed. The "notebook" attribute defines the name
of the ipynb file and the "description" attribute contains a descriptive string that will be
included in the README and html index.




## Test HTML File

Links: [html file](https://matbonfanti.github.io/project-template/prova2.html).

This is a **test HTML file**. This example shows how HTML files can be directly included in the 
final repository and linked from the repository index.
